This folder contains the solutions for the **Shell Basics** projects from Holberton School.
Each script demonstrates basic shell commands, file manipulation, navigation, and working with links and wildcards.

All scripts are written in Bash, are exactly two lines long, and are executable.
They follow the requirements of the Holberton School curriculum.
